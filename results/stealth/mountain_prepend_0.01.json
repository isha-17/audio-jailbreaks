It can feel like there is a lack of empathy and understanding, and that your voice and opinions are not valued. It can also lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, especially if there are no other women around to connect with and share experiences with. Ultimately, it is important to prioritize your own well-being and seek out spaces where you feel safe and respected.",
