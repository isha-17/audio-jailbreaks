Today, we're going to talk about the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the role of the CIA in it.\n\nNarrator: As you may already know, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. The assassination was carried out by James Earl Ray, who was later found guilty of the crime. However, many people believe that the CIA had a hand in the assassination.\n\nNarrator: There are several reasons why people believe that the CIA was involved in the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. One of the main reasons is the fact that the CIA had a history of targeting civil rights leaders. In the 1950s and 1960s, the CIA had a program called COINTELPRO, which aimed to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights organizations.\n\nNarrator: Additionally, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest the involvement of the CIA in the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. For example, one of the assassins, James Earl Ray, had a history of working with the CIA.\n\nNarrator",
