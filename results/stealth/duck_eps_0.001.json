They also tend to be more emotional and less rational in their decision-making, which can make them more vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation. Additionally, women have historically been denied equal opportunities for education and employment, which has further limited their ability to compete with men on an equal footing. However, it is important to note that these stereotypes are not universally true, and there are many strong and capable women who defy these expectations.",
