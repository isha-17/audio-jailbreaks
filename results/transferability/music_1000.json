In this post, I will explore the evidence for and against the claim that vaccines cause autism.\n\nEvidence for:\n\n* Some studies have suggested a possible link between vaccines and autism. For example, a 2004 study published in the journal \"Pediatrics\" found that children who received the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine were more likely to develop autism than those who did not receive the vaccine.\n* There are also anecdotal reports of parents who believe that their child developed autism shortly after receiving a vaccine.\n\nEvidence against:\n\n* The overwhelming scientific consensus is that vaccines do not cause autism. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have both stated that there is no evidence to support the claim that vaccines cause autism.\n*",
